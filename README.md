## 🤖 How did you use AI?

> Tell us exactly what AI services and products you used and how you used them. Be very specific.

When it comes to complex programming help, it was very helpful to consult GPT for some assistance. It felt like another team member.

- Our [ChatGPT Prompt Log](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15sE_T1InzGLhURfZ1sbZYpDkJBfUg0VNvyCVzmJe6Ik/edit?usp=sharing)

We also used OpenAI's API to implement a filter suggestion feature. We used a [List of Hobbies dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mrhell/list-of-hobbies) for the chatbot to learn from. The bot would then suggest related hobby tags for the users to add to their profile.

For example, if a user tells the bot "I love the outdoors and hiking," the bot would analyze what they said, parse it, and suggests similar tags such as `fishing`, `camping`, `biking`, etc.
